### Link to Finally project "Мир Кино" https://helen25sur.github.io/Front-End-Pro-finally-project/finally-project/dist/index.html

    This is single page application, using Local Storage for saving data, native JavaScript and classes.
    I made only functionality, i.e. wrote the JavaScript code. 
    The markup and styles was been ready when I started to work on the project. 
    (The code and all commits are in this repository, but gh-page is in another repository)
